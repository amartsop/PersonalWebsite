                    Apart from software development, I have extensive experience with the mathematical modelling of
                    physical systems. My interests
                    mainly focus on computational mechanics including the dynamics of rigid, multibody and deformable
                    systems. Over the years, I
                    have used and developed software for solving, analyzing and visualizing such systems. Examples of
                    these tools are numerical solvers
                    for both ODEs and PDEs, efficient collision detection algorithms
                    (e.g spatial hashing, KD-trees), rendering software (OpenGL) and
                    constraint methods for contact handling.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-0">
                    Further activities include the development of motion tracking and computer vision algorithms using
                    OpenCV and depth cameras, the
                    design of control algorithms for linear and nonlinear applications (MPC, LQR, Sliding Mode, Feedback
                    Linearization) and the develop-
                    ment of optimization algorithms for robotic system applications.
